# myeasyphp
This is a php framework coded by myself, just in the interest of developing a very light weighted fully secured PHP framework.
This framework is based on MVC(Model View Controller) architecture. I have also developed an ORM also for used in this framework.
This framework is not complete yet, but the whole thing that can be in a framework is under development, I am very closely working on it.
