# myeasyphp
This is a php framework developed by myself, just in the interest of developing a very light weighted, an easiest, fully secured PHP framework.
This framework follows MVC(Model View Controller) architecture. Doctrine ORM has been introduced in this framework.
This framework is not complete yet, but the whole thing that can be in a framework is under development, I am very closely working on it.

Users' guideline will be published very soon.
